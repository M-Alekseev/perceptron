## Perceptron implementation for an image recognition 
### About
The perceptron can recognize selected patterns of 3x3 pixel black & white images.
All images in this project are represent as 1D-arrays
### Usage
Run the script [perceptron](perceptron.py). If you want to change patterns to recognize then at the bottom of the script change arguments passed to a Perceptron class.
```
# You can pass agrs from 0 to 9
# because there are 10 patterns
p = Perceptron(0,1,2)
```
